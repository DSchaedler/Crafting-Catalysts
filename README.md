# Crafting-Catalysts
Minecraft Forge Mod. Adds crafting only items. Can be used to gate crafting like some items in Avaritia. Requires a way to change recipies, something like CraftTweaker.

---

Adds 10 items, called "Tier X Catalyst", where X is 1-10 respectively. The items are all generic and are deisgned only to be used during crafting. Their recipes can be set to be anything, and they can be used in any recipe. This means you can lock recipies behind the Catalysts, which can require 9 different items to craft.

Hopefully this system is a way to implement "Ages" or "Chapters" to a modpack, without needing a quest system to track it. They are closer to research packs from Factorio.

## Looking for new Textures!
I suck at making textures. If you have better ones, submit a pull request.
